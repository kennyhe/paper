Projects and paper
==================

This repository contains some of my projects and paper I did by myself or with classmates in Santa Clara University. Most of them were done within very tight schedule (2 ~ 5 weeks). However I hope I can develop some of them in a further step one day.

1. Tencent Multimedia Ads pCTR Challenge on ICME2014
Solve a contest problem in ICME2014 about predicting the pCTR (click-through rate) of multimedia advertisements of Tencent (the biggest Internet content and service provider in China, operator of QQ and wechat). In this project, I will use the machine learning knowledge to analyze the training data, and then try to predict the pCTR of the testing data.
This project is ongoing. Work together with Christopher Yu.

2. Refine search engine results with patterns
A study and implementation of "pattern based search". Firstly check whether the keyword matches certain patterns. If yes, then carry out the search based on that pattern and optimize the searching results, highlight the most possible results wanted by end users. Google, Baidu provided the similiar solutions since late 2013.
I did this study and implementation independently in Fall 2013.

3. Adding Rich Tags to Wi-Fi Scanning To Enable New Business Opportunities
A proposal about adding new beacon frames to let the Wi-Fi devices to "introduce themselves" and "match with each other". So that people can use Wi-Fi devices to do Advertising, Social Networking, Vehicle Anti-Bumping, etc.
I did this research independently in Summer 2013.

4. "So-safe" security system
https://github.com/kennyhe/SoSafeSecuritySystemSimulation
Worked with Sakshi Singh in Summer 2013.

5. Optimizating the I/O module of OS to extend the life of the SSD
Some SSD failures are caused by too frequently write in the same blocks, such as the master block area. I and my team members studied the EXT4 file system and its implementation, identify the "frequent write to the same area" operations, and then propose some changes to the current EXT4 file system. Due to the time limitation, I did not implement the code modifications but just write some simulation code to verify the feasibility of the solutions. Later I checked the implementation of F2FS (Flash-Friendly File System, created by Kim Jaegeuk at Samsung) and found some of our proposal have already been implemented in it.
Worked with Tina Jain in Spring 2013.

6. Wi-Fi Chat
Developed a chat application based on Wi-Fi Direct feature on ANDROID. It contains a chat UI, and a client/server model based on Java socket.

Worked with Meenakshi and Soujanya in Spring 2013.
